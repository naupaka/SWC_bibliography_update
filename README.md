Updating SWC bibliography
==========

Some code to work on updating (perhaps keeping up-to-date) the [SWC bibliography](http://software-carpentry.org/bib/software-carpentry.bib).

Based on work done on the scholar.py script by [Christian Kreibich](https://github.com/ckreibich) -> original repo [here](https://github.com/ckreibich/scholar.py).
